# SenecaServerImplementation
Seneca Simple Server Implementation

The project has just one file "main.js" with seneca implementation.
The code contains just enough part to showcase the implementation of seneca as microservice plug in which when hit from a URL (via POSTMAN or browser), will output "Hello Friend!"


TO BEGIN:
--------------------------------
Move to project directory and run:
$ npm install

To run the seneca server:
$npm start

If all is successful, it will run and output "Running on port: 4000" in console

Now head to browser or POSTMAN and do a get request with
http://localhost:4000/writeAnything/home

Hurray!
